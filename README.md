**Objective** To screen the gene signature for distinguishing patients with high risks from those with low-risks for
colon cancer recurrence and predicting their prognosis.\
**Methods** Five microarray datasets of colon cancer samples were collected from Gene Expression Omnibus database
and one was obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). After preprocessing, data in GSE17537 were
analyzed using the Linear Models for Microarray data (LIMMA) method to identify the differentially expressed
genes (DEGs). The DEGs further underwent PPI network-based neighborhood scoring and support vector machine
(SVM)analyses to screen the feature genes associatedwith recurrence and prognosis,whichwere then validated
by four datasets GSE38832, GSE17538, GSE28814 and TCGA using SVM and Cox regression analyses.\
**Results** A total of 1207 genes were identified as DEGs between recurrence and no-recurrence samples, including
726 downregulated and 481 upregulated genes. Using SVManalysis and five gene expression profile data confirmation,
a 15-gene signature (HES5, ZNF417, GLRA2, OR8D2, HOXA7, FABP6,MUSK, HTR6, GRIP2, KLRK1, VEGFA,
AKAP12, RHEB, NCRNA00152 and PMEPA1) were identified as a predictor of recurrence risk and prognosis for
colon cancer patients.\
**Conclusion** Our identified 15-gene signature may be useful to classify colon cancer patients with different prognosis
and some genes in this signature may represent new therapeutic targets
